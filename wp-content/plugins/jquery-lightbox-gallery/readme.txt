Fancy Gallery associates linked images and galleries with the jQuery Fancybox. This Plugin has been granted the "Famous Software" Award!


== Description ==
[Fancy Gallery](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) is a state of the art WordPress [Gallery Plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) you can use to create, manage and handle image galleries easily in your WordPress backend and present images to your website visitors.

It migrates the Fancy Image Box to your WordPress. All links pointing to an image will automatically open in the FancyBox. If you use the [gallery] shortcode the images will get a navigation bar and the gallery itself will be converted to a valid HTML block.

Of course you can use "exclude" and "include" parameters in your [gallery] shortcode like you already know from the traditional gallery code.

If you want to display links in the fancybox add the class "fancyframe" to them! ;)

Btw: Fancy Gallery is available as [Premium Plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) too.
